description: Minimize git diff by comparing changes to original code
---

Review the current changes in the working directory and suggest ways to minimize the diff:

1. Check if any formatting changes can be reverted
2. Identify unnecessary whitespace changes
3. Look for refactoring that could be simplified
4. Suggest splitting large changes into focused commits
5. Check if comments can match existing style
6. Identify any accidental changes that should be reverted

Use `git diff` to see the current changes and provide specific recommendations.
