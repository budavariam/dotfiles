description: Debug TypeScript/JavaScript by adding detailed logging
---

Add comprehensive logging to help debug the selected code:

1. Log function entry with parameters
2. Log important intermediate values
3. Log conditional branch taken
4. Log function exit with return value
5. Include timestamp and context in logs
6. Use console.group for nested function calls

Format logs to be easily searchable (e.g., prefix with 🐛 DEBUG).
