description: Optimize code for better performance
---

Analyze the selected code for performance improvements:

1. Identify unnecessary re-renders (React)
2. Find expensive operations in loops
3. Suggest memoization opportunities
4. Identify memory leaks
5. Recommend lazy loading
6. Suggest debouncing/throttling
7. Check for unnecessary DOM operations

Provide specific optimizations with code examples and performance impact estimates.
