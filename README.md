# dotfiles

> Because life's too short to manually setup my machine

## Getting started

You should check out this repository into `~/projects/dotfiles` folder. 
If you want to check out to another location make sure you change all references to that folder in this repository, before starting it.

> Make sure you **know** what you are doing! Check the scripts if it's necessary.

Run `setup.sh`.

## How it works

The `setup.sh` script replaces some config files with symlinks pointing to this repository.
This gives you the possibility to revision your config files, and make it easy to set up your new workstation with similar settings as your current one.

## What it contains

These are **my** most common settings that I use day by day in my UNIX based systems.
It contains aliases for shell, common gitignore patterns, aliases for git and settings for vscode and vim.
These might change over time.
Feel free to fork it and customize it with your own needs.
